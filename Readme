I did not removed node_modules so you just need to download zip file of this froject and open it in any code edditor go to front directory and run command "npm start"
go back to main directory and go to generator directory and run command "npm start" a file will be open in your default browser just refresh it.If you are properly follow this step 
website will run successfully.You will see an input field give comma separated roll number input number only(because I did not put a validation to Input) and click submit button 
It(client) will send data to generator(Server) and generator having myapi file will return a coresponding data from given API about roll number and return to our front(client)
which will append the array and wait untill all the data will receive successfully and it will render it to our webpage.
